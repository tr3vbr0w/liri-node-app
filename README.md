## About Liri
    The liri app is intended to take user entertainment input into the command line and search multiple APIs for propper information.

## Overview

Axios will be the primary driver of the app. Upon the user entering information into the readable location for process.argv, the string will be passed into an API call for each of the API's.

## How to Run this file

Open your bash capable command line and prepare to run a node file. When you run liri.js, prepare to enter a band name, movie name, or seek a concert located nearby. Liri will return to you relevant information based on the search cricteria entered into the command line.

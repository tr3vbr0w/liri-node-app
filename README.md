## About Liri
    The liri app is intended to take user entertainment input from the command line and search multiple APIs for propper information.

## Overview

Axios will be the primary driver of the app. Upon the user entering information into the first readable location for process.argv, the string at the second readable location will be passed into an API call for the selected API's.

## How to Run this file

Open your bash capable command line and prepare to run a node file. When you run liri.js, enter a band name, movie name, or seek a concert located nearby. You may also edit the file random.js. Liri will return to you relevant information based on the search cricteria entered into the command line.
